        <h2> Context </h2>
        <p class="slim-text">Super Mario 64 is the first 3D platforming 
game in the Mario Series created by Nintendo. To get through the game 
one must collect a certain number of "power stars" to advace through the
 castle. This page will cover many different categories of runs with the
 difference being the number of "power stars" collected since you can 
use glitches in the game to get through certain parts of the castle. </p>

  <div class="container2">
      <div class="six boxes">
        <h4>120 star <i class="far fa-star small-star" aria-hidden="true"></i></h4>
        <p>This is every single star in the game. These runs usually are
 1 hour 45 minutes long.This is the hardest run to do since it is the 
longest. The current world record is 1:38:28 by the runner simply.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="seven boxes">
        <h4>70 star <i class="far fa-star small-star" aria-hidden="true"></i></h4>
        <p>This is the minimum amount of stars needed to beat the game 
without any glitches. These runs are usually 50 minutes and are a good 
middle ground for runners. The current world record is 46:59 by 
Dwhatever.</p>
        <p class="center WR"><a href="https://www.speedrun.com/sm64/run/znkq498z">WR RUN</a></p>

      <div class="eight boxes">
        <h4>16 star <i class="far fa-star small-star" aria-hidden="true"></i></h4>
        <p>This is a good beginner run for the game. It requires the use
 of a glitch in the game called a BLJ or backwards long jump. These runs
 are usually 20 minutes. The current world record is 14:59 by akki</p>

        <h4>Tool Assisted Speedruns </h4>
        <p class="slim-text">Tool Assisted Speedruns or also know as TAS
 runs are some of the most optimized runs in any game due to the fact 
that coding scripts are used to control the game. In mario there are 
frame perfect inputs done in these runs that are humanly impossible. I 
would suggest just watching the TAS world record for mario 64 as it is 
impressively optimized</p>

        <h4>Twitch</h4>
        <p>The best part about speedrunning is how entertaining it can 
be to watch live. There is something really cool about watching someone 
beat their personal best live. Below are links to my personal favorite 
twitch channels and the mario64 section so you can tune in live.</p>

        <h4>Why you should care</h4>
        <p>Because Nintendo just put out a higher resolution of Mario 64
 on the switch. Now more than ever are people playing this game. Also 
speed running is fun, and the more runners the merrier.</p>
