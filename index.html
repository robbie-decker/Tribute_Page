        <h3> Context </h3>
        <p>Super Mario 64 is the first 3D platforming game in the Mario Series created by Nintendo. To get through the game one must collect a certain number of "power stars" to advace through the castle. This page will cover many different categories of runs with the difference being the number of "power stars" collected since you can use glitches in the game to get through certain parts of the castle. </p>

        <h4>120 star</h4>
        <p>This is every single star in the game. These runs usually are 1 hour 45 minutes long. The current world record is 1:38:28 by the runner simply.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="seven">
        <h4>70 star</h4>
        <p>This is the minimum amount of stars needed to beat the game without any glitches. These runs are usually 50 minutes. The current world record is 46:59 by Dwhatever.<i class="far fa-star"></i></p>
      </div>
      <div class="eight">
        <h4>16 star</h4>
        <p>This is a good beginner run for the game. It requires the use of a glitch in the game called a BLJ or backwards long jump. These runs are usually 20 minutes. The current world record is 14:59 by akki</p>
      </div>
      <div class="nine">
        <h4>Tool Assisted Speedruns </h4>
        <p>Tool Assisted Speedruns or also know as TAS runs are some of the most optimized runs in any game due to the fact that coding scripts are used to control the game. In mario there are frame perfect inputs done in these runs that are humanly impossible. I would suggest just watching the TAS world record for mario 64 as it is impressively optimized</p>

        <h4>Twitch</h4>
        <p>The best part about speedrunning is how entertaining it can be to watch live. There is something really cool about watching someone beat their personal best live. Below are links to my personal favorite twitch channels and the mario64 section so you can tune in live.</p>
